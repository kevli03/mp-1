                    <h4 id="research-title">Analysis of the Structure of Simple Autocatalytic Metabolic Networks</h4>

                    <p id="research-passage-1">An unanswered question in origin of life research is how complex molecules could have formed in high
                    concentrations in primitive conditions. Autocatalytic sets have been proposed as a solution to this problem. An autocatalytic
                    set comprises a set of molecules interacting in chemical reactions, each of which is catalyzed by a molecule within the set.
                    In this manner, the set is able to sustain the production of its constituents and build complex molecules. We have built
                    artificial chemistries for computational modeling of catalytic networks in order to investigate properties of autocatalytic sets
                    built from simple molecules. One aspect we have investigated is the change in autocatalytic set size with varying catalytic
                    probability, defined as the probability of any given molecule in the network to catalyze any given reaction in the network.
                    This probability is analogous to the <strong>sparsity</strong> of a catalytic matrix encompassing all possible combinations of
                    molecules (candidate catalysts) and reactions.</p>

                        <div id="research-data">

                        </div>

                        <p id="research-passage-2">The attached figure displays a graph of autocatalytic set size (presented
                        as the fraction of the number of reactions in the autocatalytic set over the number of all possible reactions in the network)
                        against catalytic matrix sparsity. We observe a sigmoidal shape, which is consistent with previous research that has
                        commented on <em>phase transitions</em> in autocatalytic set size.</p>
